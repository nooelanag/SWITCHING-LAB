## HOW TO RUN THE CODE:

In order to run this program we created a MAKEFILE.
In the terminal go to the directory where the files have been downloaded.
If "make file" is written, the code will be compiled.
Each of the given tests can be run by executing ```make test1```, ```make test2``` and ```make test3``` respectively.
If it is desired to run a Valgrind analysis, the required commands for test 1, test 2 and test3 are: ```make valgrind1```,```make valgrind2``` and ```make valgrind3``` respectively.
The output files after executing the tests can be found in the folder named "Assets".
